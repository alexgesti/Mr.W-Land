## History

On any given day, Mr.W while watching television, he found a very interesting news channel.
In it they were explaining the news of the Dream Caves, in which nobody had ever explored them, but it was rumored that at the end of the caves was hidden a treasure so big that it is worth millions.
Our hero thought that this treasure would help him to do what he wanted, including buying a giant gold statue of himself.
With which he left immediately for the Dream Caves in search of this treasure to be done with him and thus get that statue of giant gold that he wanted so much.
